## Why does this project exist?

When you operate Cloudflare — or similar edge/CDN platforms such as Tencent EdgeOne — the official documentation usually explains the happy path. Real production work is different. You run into questions like:

- Why does `525 SSL handshake failed` keep happening even though the origin server is alive?
- Why does `wrangler deploy` return `Authentication failed [code: 9106]` when the token looks correct?
- Why does a React/Vite SPA deployed to Pages show a blank white screen with only the page title left?
- Why do users in mainland China sometimes hit mysterious 403 white pages?

This repository collects the kinds of **dangerous, practical failure modes that official docs often skip, plus the troubleshooting SOPs that actually fix them**.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome. The most valuable contributions are not basic API tutorials, but real failure records: **what broke, why it broke, how you proved the root cause, and what actually fixed it**.

Good contributions usually include:

- the exact symptom or error code;
- the environment where it happened;
- failed assumptions or misleading official-doc paths;
- reproducible checks or commands;
- the final working fix;
- caveats, rollback notes, and prevention tips.
